## Pinball

Pinball is a game I'm really passionate about ever since I received my first video game at 5 years old (Pinball Hall of Fame: Williams Collection.
I wanted to explore how pinball changed over time, more specifically, to look into what manufacturers dominated the market, what pinball machines and themes were popopular, where in the world are the most machines located, if pinball machines became larger, and more so.
