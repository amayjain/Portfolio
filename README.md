## Pinball

Pinball is a game I've been passionate about ever since I received my first video game at 5 years old (Pinball Hall of Fame: Williams Collection).

I wanted to explore how pinball changed over time, more specifically, to look into what manufacturers dominated the market, what pinball machines and themes were popular, where in the world are most machines located, if pinball machines became larger, and so on.

Using the OPDB and Pinball Map APIs, I was able to collect data on over 28000 machines and over 7000 locations worldwide. I then used Pandas and MySQL to help me process and join different data tables together.

With all the clean data, I then turned to Tableau and created multiple dashboards (one for History and one for Geography) that can be toggled to gain a better understanding of what I was trying to look into.

## Baseball

As a member of Bruin Sports Analytics, I had the chance to co-write an article on a sport of our choosing, and without a doubt, it was baseball for us. My partner and I wanted to look into how WAR was distributed across the league as a whole because WAR is primarily an individual statistic and see if there were any correlations with regular/postseason success.
