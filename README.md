## Pinball

Pinball is a game I'm really passionate about ever since I received my first video game at 5 years old (Pinball Hall of Fame: Williams Collection).

I wanted to explore how pinball changed over time, more specifically, to look into what manufacturers dominated the market, what pinball machines and themes were popular, where in the world are the most machines located, if pinball machines became larger, and so on.

Using the OPDB and Pinball Map APIs, I was able to collect data on over 28000 machines and over 7000 locations worldwide. I then used Pandas and MySQL to help me process and join different data tables together.

With all the clean data, I then turned to Tableau and created multiple dashboards (one for History and one for Geography) that can be toggled to gain some better understanding into what I was trying to look into.
